# Explicit Intent :

1) An explicit intent is an Intent where you explicitly define the component that needs to be called by the Android System. 
2) An explicit intent is one that you can use to launch a specific app component, such as a particular activity or service in your app.
3) You'll typically use an explicit intent to start a component in your own app, because you know the class name of the activity or service you want to start. 
4) For example, you might start a new activity within your app in response to a user action, or start a service to download a file in the background.
5) To create an explicit intent, define the component name for the Intent objectâ€”all other intent properties are optional.

The program [Explicit Intent](ExplicitIntent/ExplicitIntentDemo1) demonstrates Explicit Intent.
