# Implicit Intent :

1) The implicit intent is the intent where instead of defining the exact components, 
you define the action that you want to perform for different activities.
2) An Implicit intent specifies an action that can invoke any app on the device to be able to perform an action. 
Using an Implicit Intent is useful when your app cannot perform the action but other apps probably can and youâ€™d like the user to pick which app to use.
3)  For example, if you want to show the user a location on a map, you can use an 
implicit intent to request that another capable app show a specified location on a map.
4) To advertise which implicit intents your app can receive, declare one or more 
intent filters for each of your app components with an <intent-filter> element in your manifest file.


The program [Implicit Intent](ImplicitIntent/ImplicitIntentDemo1) demonstrates Implicit Intent.
