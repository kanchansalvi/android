# COMPONENTS :
Repo for all Components in Android Projects

# Components :

- Application components are the essential building blocks of an Android application. 
- These components are loosely coupled by the application **manifest file AndroidManifest.xml** 
that describes each component of the application and how they interact.
- Whenever you create or use any of them, you must include elements in the project manifest.
- There are following four main components that can be used within an Android application:
    1) Activities : They dictate the UI and handle the user interaction to the smart phone screen.
    2) Services :  They handle background processing associated with an application.
    3) Broadcast Receivers : They handle communication between Android OS and applications.
    4) Content Providers : They handle data and database management issues.
