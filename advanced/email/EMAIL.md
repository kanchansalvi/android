# Email :

1) In android, we can easily send an email from our android application using 
existing email clients such as GMAIL, Outlook, etc. instead of building an email client from scratch.
2) Generally, the Intent object in android with proper action (ACTION_SEND) 
and data will help us to launch the available email clients to send an email in our application.
3) For this purpose, we need to write an Activity that launches an email client, using an implicit Intent with the right action and data.


The Example [EmailDemo1](EmailDemo1) we are going 
to send an email from our app by using an Intent object that launches existing email clients.
