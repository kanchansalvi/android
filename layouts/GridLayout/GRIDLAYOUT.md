- Other LAyouts can also be used to create GridLayout.   
**Why use GridLayout?**
1. **I can use nested LinearLayout to create grid!**   
  Yes, but you can have performance problems in hierarchies that are too deep.

2. **I can use RelativeLayout to create grid!**  
   Yes, but RelativeLayout has some limitations, like:
   - inability to control alignment along both axes simultaneously.
   - widgets can get off the screen / overlap when they take more space than you expected because you can’t use weigh, etc.
   In other words RelativeLayout — is not flexible and responsive enough.
