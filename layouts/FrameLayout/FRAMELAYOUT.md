# FrameLayout :

- FrameLayout is designed to block out an area on the screen to display a single item.
- We can have multiple elements within a FrameLayout but each element will be positioned based on the top left of the screen. 
- In FrameLayout, all the child views added are placed like stack. 
- The most recent added are shown on top. Hence the order of elements in the layout is of importance.
- Itâ€™s used in cases such as placing a TextView over an ImageView.

Check the [FrameLayoutDemo1](FrameLayoutDemo1)where TextView is placed over ImageView.
