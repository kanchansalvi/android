# SPACE
Repo for Space Layout in Android Projects

# Space :

- Used to create gaps between components in layouts. 
- Attribute "background" in Space does not change background color, 
as it is drawable.   
Use view ( [HorizontalDivider](https://github.com/kanchansalvi/android/tree/master/uiControls/HorizontalDividerDemo1) ) if you need to apply color in gap.
