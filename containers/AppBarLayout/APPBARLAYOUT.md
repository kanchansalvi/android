# AppBarLayout :

1) AppBarLayout is a ViewGroup, most commonly used to wrap a Toolbar.  
2) AppBarLayout depends heavily on being used as a direct child of the CoordinatorLayout and reacts to a sibling that supports scrolling (e.g. NestedScrollView, RecyclerView).    
3) Flags are added to each child of the AppBarLayout to control how they will respond to scrolling. 
4) If you want just to include the Toolbar without any scrolling effects you can use Toolbar. But if you want to make some scrolling effects like on the images you need to use AppBarLayout.   

The program [AppBarLayoutDemo1](AppBarLayoutDemo1) shows wrapping of ToolBar by AppBarLayout.
