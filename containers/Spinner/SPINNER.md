# Spinner :

- Spinner provides a quick way to select one value from a set of values. 
Android spinners are the drop down-list.
- In a default state, a spinner shows its currently selected value.
 It provides a easy way to select a value from a list of values.
- Spinner is associated with Adapter view so to fill the data in spinner we need to use one of the Adapter class.
- To fill the data in a spinner we need to implement an adapter class. 
- A spinner is mainly used to display only text field so we can implement Array Adapter for that. 
We can also use Base Adapter and other custom adapters to display a spinner with more customize list. 
 
The program [SpinnerDemo1](SpinnerDemo1) demonstrates Spinner with ArrayAdapter.
