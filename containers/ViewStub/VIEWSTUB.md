# ViewStub :

1) A ViewStub is an invisible, zero-sized View that can be used to lazily inflate layout resources at runtime.
2) When a ViewStub is made visible, or when inflate() is invoked, the layout resource is inflated. 
The ViewStub then replaces itself in its parent with the inflated View or Views.
3) When inflate() is invoked, the ViewStub is replaced by the inflated View and the inflated View is returned. 

The program [ViewStubDemo1](ViewStubDemo1) demonstrates using it.
